This food recommendation system leverages collaborative filtering in Python to provide personalized dish suggestions.

The program captures user preferences, storing them in a matrix with scores. It then asks for available ingredients and recommends dishes that match both the userâ€™s interests and current ingredients.
Additionally, the system compares dishes based on various factors, such as oiliness, cooking time, preparation time, ingredients used, and spiciness, to recommend similar options that suit user preferences.

Currently, the project is evolving into an Android application, making it more accessible and convenient for users to enjoy tailored food recommendations on the go.
